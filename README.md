VAE - Vulkan Android Engine
========
#### Android 3D library ####

The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, general purpose 3D library.

We love design philosophy of [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) (the best API design as a web based 3D engine), so this will be a pair with Three.js for Three.js fan.

Give a highest respect to Three.js!
